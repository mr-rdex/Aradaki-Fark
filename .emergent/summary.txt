<analysis>
The trajectory details the development of an Aradaki Fark car comparison website. Initially, the user requested an ASP.NET Core application, but the AI engineer successfully guided them to use FastAPI (Python) for the backend, React (JavaScript) for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database, aligning with the platform's capabilities.

The development proceeded iteratively, starting with core backend functionalities (API endpoints, data models, authentication) and populating initial car data. Subsequently, the frontend was built, incorporating a robust UI, routing, and user authentication. Several bugs were addressed, primarily related to frontend rendering (e.g.,  syntax, dropdown overflows, mobile responsiveness).

After the initial build, the user requested significant feature enhancements, including an admin panel, user profiles, favorites, reviews, advanced filtering, loading skeletons, toast notifications, recently viewed cars, and popular comparisons. The AI engineer systematically implemented these, consistently restarting frontend/backend and summarizing progress. The current work involves adding a PDF comparison report download feature. The process has been highly collaborative, with frequent user feedback and AI engineer adjustments.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an Aradaki Fark car comparison website. Key features include:
- A homepage with a car comparison tool, most popular cars, and best cars categories (e.g., best baggage, acceleration, economy, horsepower, lowest price).
- A navbar with a searchable car dropdown/input, allowing users to view car photos and detailed features in a separate page/popup.
- A comprehensive car database using MongoDB with specified fields (CarID, ArabaMarka, CarModel, CarYear, etc.).
- A user-specified color theme ().
- **Expanded features (requested later):** Real car photos (using ), an admin panel for car management, user registration/login, user profiles, favorite cars, saved comparisons, car reviews/ratings.
- **Further enhancements:** Toast notifications, loading/skeleton components, advanced filtering (collapsible on desktop), displaying category-specific stats on car cards, improved mobile responsiveness (especially for profile tabs, search, and dropdowns), recently viewed cars section on the homepage, and a Popular Comparisons page.
- The latest request is for a PDF comparison report download.
- Strong emphasis on mobile-first design.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (NoSQL database), JWT Authentication.
- **Frontend:** React.js (JavaScript library), Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework), React Context API for state management (Auth, Toast).
- **Other:** UUIDs for IDs, environment variables for configuration, Supervisor for process management,  and  for PDF generation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a standard full-stack structure:



-   ****: Main FastAPI application. Configured with CORS, handles all API routes (cars, auth, favorites, reviews, admin).
-   ****: Defines Pydantic models for , , ,  to structure data for MongoDB and FastAPI.
-   ****: Implements JWT token generation and validation, password hashing, and dependency injection for authenticated routes.
-   ****: A script used to populate the MongoDB database with initial car data (30 cars) and an admin user.
-   ****: The main React component, responsible for defining routes using  and wrapping the application with  and  providers.
-   ****: Global CSS styles, including Tailwind CSS imports and custom animations for toast notifications.
-   ****: Provides global authentication state and functions (login, logout, register, current user data) to React components.
-   ****: Provides global functionality for displaying transient notification messages (toasts) across the application.
-   ****: Centralized module for making API calls to the backend, using  and handling authentication headers.
-   ****: Contains all main page components like , , , , , , , , .
-   ****: Contains reusable UI components such as , ,  (which includes searchable dropdowns),  (for loading states), and  (for filtering cars on ).
-   ****: Utility functions for interacting with the browser's local storage, specifically for tracking recently viewed cars.
-   ****: A new utility file being created to handle the logic for converting HTML content to a PDF document using  and .
-   ****: Provides documentation for the project setup, usage, and features.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the PDF Comparison Report Download feature. This involved two main steps:
1.  **Installing Libraries:** The  and  libraries were added to the frontend dependencies using yarn add v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.. This was confirmed by the yarn output in the trajectory.
2.  **Creating PDF Utility:** A new file, , was successfully created. This file is intended to encapsulate the logic for generating a PDF from a given HTML element.

The next planned action, where the trajectory ended, was to integrate this  utility into the  to add a PDF download button, allowing users to export their comparison results.
