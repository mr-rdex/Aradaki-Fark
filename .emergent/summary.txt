The AI engineer successfully built an Aradaki Fark car comparison website, initially guiding the user to a FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack. The development was iterative, implementing core functionalities, fixing bugs, and progressively adding significant features based on user feedback. Key additions included a PDF comparison report, a comprehensive admin panel (for car, user, forum, badge, and cover photo management), user-based comparison history, forum functionality (topics, comments, likes, solutions), and extensive dark mode implementation across the entire site. The engineer consistently addressed UI/UX refinements, responsive issues, and backend API problems, ensuring features worked as intended and resolving syntax errors. The work demonstrates systematic problem-solving and responsiveness to evolving product requirements, leading to a feature-rich application.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to create an Aradaki Fark car comparison website. Initial requirements included a homepage with a comparison tool, most popular/best cars, a searchable navbar, a MongoDB database for car data, and a  color theme. Expanded features later requested encompassed real car photos, an admin panel for car/user/forum/badge/cover photo management, user authentication, profiles, favorite cars, saved comparisons, reviews, toast notifications, loading skeletons, advanced filtering, mobile responsiveness, recently viewed cars, and a Popular Comparisons page. The engineer also implemented a PDF comparison report download. Subsequent requests focused on making comparison history user-based (DB instead of localStorage), showing forum replies on profiles, adding a customizable profile background (cover photo, admin-managed), and a badge system (admin-managed). A full site-wide dark mode with specific styling for inputs, comparison boxes, and text colors was also requested and implemented. The application prioritizes a mobile-first design.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on refining the dark mode implementation based on user feedback. The user explicitly requested two changes:
1.  **Comparison Box Styling**: The comparison boxes on the homepage (within ) should have a dark background. Specifically, the second comparison box was explicitly requested to be black.
2.  **Login/Register Page Titles**: The Hoşgeldiniz (Welcome) text on the login and register pages should be white in dark mode.

The engineer had just started addressing these points, specifically editing  and had completed applying dark mode styling to the first comparison box and was about to address the second box as per the user's latest instruction.
